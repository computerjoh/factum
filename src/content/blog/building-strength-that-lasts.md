Strength that holds up under pressure starts with moving well. Before we load the bar, we run athletes through a quick mobility and activation series to make sure joints can reach the positions a clean lift demands. That lets us coach force production without compensations creeping in.

Once movement looks clean, we build a plan around progressive overload. We keep the playbook simple: add load or reps weekly, stay in RPE 7–8 for most work, and rotate primary lifts every 4–6 weeks. Athletes log every session so we can spot stalls early and adjust volume before fatigue piles up.

Recovery sessions are baked into the calendar, not treated as optional. We pair lower-body strength days with light sled pulls and breathing work, then use tempo accessories to groove positions without crushing nervous systems. The result: athletes leave the gym feeling better, not just tired.
