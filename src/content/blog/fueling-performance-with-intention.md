Good training turns into great training when nutrition keeps up. We start with the basics: 0.7–1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, consistent carbohydrates before lifting, and a post-session meal within 90 minutes.

Hydration gets equal attention. Athletes track water intake and add electrolytes on high-heat or double-session days. We also taper caffeine after noon to protect sleep, which is the fastest recovery tool most people ignore.

A small tweak we love: moving more calories to the hours surrounding training. That keeps energy high inside the session without changing total daily intake. The payoff is better bar speed, fewer mid-session crashes, and cleaner recovery markers the next day.
