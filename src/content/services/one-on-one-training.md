copy: "Personal Training offers the most specific program possible for the athlete. We start by creating a needs analysis to determine what we need to work on the most, and then develop an in-depth program to fit the athletes' needs and goals. Within these programs, our coaches are able to spend more time breaking down compensation patterns and improper movement patterns to promote proper biomechanics and joint health. 1 on 1 sessions are 60 minutes long and are scheduled directly with your trainer."
