copy: "Our small group training program is designed to create the best, well-rounded athlete possible. With groups of no more than 8 athletes, we are able to give specific cues and modifications to fit the athletes' needs, while being able to work out in a group environment. In all sports performance groups, we focus on mobility, activation, power, strength, hypertrophy and endurance. Along with that, there is a large focus on injury prevention and preventative care."
