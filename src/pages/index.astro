With groups of no more than 8 athletes, we are able to give specific cues and modifications to fit the athletes' needs, while being able to work out in a group environment. In all sports performance groups, we focus on mobility, activation, power, strength, hypertrophy and endurance. Along with that, there is a large focus on injury prevention and preventative care.",

We start by creating a needs analysis to determine what we need to work on the most, and then develop an in-depth program to fit the athletes' needs and goals. Within these programs, our coaches are able to spend more time breaking down compensation patterns and improper movement patterns to promote proper biomechanics and joint health. 1 on 1 sessions are 60 minutes long and are scheduled directly with your trainer.",

Although we can\'t avoid all injuries, preventative health and injury prevention measures can help avoid as many non-contact injuries as possible.',
